The cathedral is thought to have been conceived and commenced in about 1175 by Reginald Fitz Jocelin, who died in 1191.[22][23][24] Although it is clear from its size that from the outset, the church was planned to be the cathedral of the diocese,[21] the seat of the bishop moved between Wells and the abbeys of Glastonbury and Bath, before settling at Wells. In 1197 Reginald's successor, Savaric FitzGeldewin, with the approval of Pope Celestine III, officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey. The title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219.[25]

Savaric's successor, Jocelin of Wells, again moved the bishop's seat to Bath Abbey, with the title Bishop of Bath. Jocelin was a brother of Hugh (II) of Lincoln[26] and was present at the signing of the Magna Carta. Jocelin continued the building campaign begun by Reginald and was responsible for the Bishop's Palace, the choristers' school, a grammar school, a hospital for travellers and a chapel. He also had a manor house built at Wookey, near Wells.[27] Jocelin saw the church dedicated in 1239 but, despite much lobbying of the Pope by Jocelin's representatives in Rome, did not live to see cathedral status granted. The delay may have been a result of inaction by Pandulf Verraccio, a Roman ecclesiastical politician, papal legate to England and Bishop of Norwich, who was asked by the Pope to investigate the situation but did not respond.[28] Jocelin died at Wells on 19 November 1242 and was buried in the choir of the cathedral;[26][27][29] the memorial brass on his tomb is one of the earliest brasses in England.[27] Following his death the monks of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells.[30]

In 1245 the ongoing dispute over the title of the bishop was resolved by a ruling of Pope Innocent IV, who established the title as the "Bishop of Bath and Wells", which it has remained until this day, with Wells as the principal seat of the bishop.[31] Since the 11th century the church has had a chapter of secular clergy, like the cathedrals of Chichester, Hereford, Lincoln and York. The chapter was endowed with 22 prebends (lands from which finance was drawn) and a provost to manage them. On acquiring cathedral status, in common with other such cathedrals, it had four chief clergy, the dean, precentor, chancellor and sacristan, who were responsible for the spiritual and material care of the cathedral.
The earthquake occurred at 02:58 UTC (7:28 a.m. Iran Standard Time),[4][10] while many of the estimated 60 million Iranians affected[16] were in their homes.[9] Its duration was seven seconds,[2] and the epicenter was near the settlement of Bou'in-Zahra[17] in the Khar river valley,[11] a mountainous farming region[15] about 60 kilometres (37 mi) from the provincial capital of Qazvin.[18] The greatest damage was across an area best known for its seedless grape harvesting, a getaway for wealthy residents of Tehran.[15] At least 230 people were killed, 1,500 injured, and 25,000 left homeless.[1] An earlier death toll was reported as 500, but this number was believed to be inflated once it became known that some of the severely injured had been mistaken for dead.[8] Most of the dead were women, children and the elderly,[19] as many of the men were working in local vineyards.[20] Over 20 aftershocks were recorded,[1] with magnitudes up to 5.1 on the moment magnitude scale.[11] At least three of these caused further casualties and damage,[21] most of which were within a 25 kilometres (16 mi) radius of the main shock.[22]

An estimated 5,000 buildings were damaged beyond repair.[15] In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed.[10] A large majority of houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed.[23] As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with structural failure and collapse resulting from wall-to-wall separation and the lack of structural integrity and of a proper lateral system of resisting.[24] Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for seismic-resistant design fared much better.[23] Damage to the historic Kharaqan tomb towers, which were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggests that the earthquake was possibly one of the most powerful in the region for approximately 900 years.[11]

At a station 28 kilometres (17 mi) from the epicenter, the maximum horizontal and vertical accelerations were recorded to be roughly 0.5 g and 0.26 g.[23] A bridge collapsed as a result of the disaster.[10] Water and irrigation systems were severely damaged near the epicenter,[4] and water facilities were demolished in nine villages.[10] Many of the main water pipelines in the affected areas were damaged or destroyed, causing inadequacies in water availability and quality.[16] Surface cracks were observed in Ab Darreh and Changureh, the villages that suffered the heaviest damage,[4] being roughly 25 kilometres (16 mi) from the epicenter.[11]

The relatively low levels of damage in the towns of Avaj or Ab-e-Garm in comparison to Changureh and Ab Darreh suggest a focus of damage to the northwest of the epicenter due to northwest propagation.[11] In Changureh, only two buildings were left standing and over 120 casualties occurred. Ab Darreh also fared poorly; the disaster destroyed the town's only mosque, toppled 40 homes and killed at least 20 people.[17] North of Avaj, in the village of Esmailabad, survivors recovered 38 corpses, a ninth of the total population, while searching for the missing, feared trapped in the ruins.[20] In another village in the vicinity, Aliabad, two shepherds were the only known survivors. In the small village of Kisse-Jin, roughly 80 corpses were recovered following the rupture.[15] Survivors crying and beating their heads and faces over loved ones were a common sight on Iranian state television.[20]

The cost of the damage was estimated at US$91 million.[4][d] The quake was felt across a wide area, including the provinces of Qazvin, Gilan, Kurdistan, Zanjan, and Hamedan.[1] Of all these, Qazvin was the most heavily damaged, with an unnamed Qazvin official reporting that 177 had died in the province.[15] It was also felt in the capital of Tehran, roughly 290 kilometres (180 mi) east of the epicenter,[10] although no serious damage was reported.[17] However, Iranian journalist Borzou Daragahi reported that in Tehran he saw buildings sway and glass objects shatter.[15]
